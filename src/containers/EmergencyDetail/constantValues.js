    description: `My wife had severe food poisoning some time ago. She had to undergo an endoscopy. But when we returned home, she had breathing trouble. Realising the seriousness of the situation, we contacted Emoha's Emergency Response Team through our Emoha Daughter, Mahima. The ERT arrived and connected us to their on-call emergency doctor, Dr Bawa, who calmed us down and ensured my wife had a mobile oxygen tank to relieve her breathlessness. The ERT team then took us to the nearest hospital and got us admitted to the emergency room. They took care of the admission and the paperwork, so there was no distraction, and we could all focus on my wife getting the right treatment. She is better now. And I owe all this to Emoha and its wonderful team of miracle workers. Emoha truly is a lifeline for us.`,

    description: `My elderly mother, who is staying in Gurgaon, had a sudden emergency when she could not breathe. Emoha's Emergency Response Team was so quick to act. Within 20 minutes of Emoha being informed, the emergency room was booked. A nurse was there to give my mother oxygen and move her by ambulance to the hospital, which really saved her life. The nurse reassured me. The team also kept me informed about what was happening and how they were proceeding with it, and they were taking my input too.`,

    description: `My father fell in the bathroom, and he needed immediate medical attention. Though I did call for an emergency ambulance service from a nearby hospital, Emoha was quick to respond too. Their presence was definitely an added help. In Delhi-NCR, we travel mostly for work, and the distance is long. That time is crucial when damage control must be activated. We might take time reaching home, but Emoha will be there much earlier.`,
