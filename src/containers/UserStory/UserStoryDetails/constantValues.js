        'When we’re stressed or busy or feeling overwhelmed, it’s hard to take the time to slow down. The world seems to whiz past us, and the last thing on our mind is, well, taking care of it. After a long day, intentionally spending time with our mind — specifically for 10 minutes — may feel useless, unnecessary, or even scary. ',

Speaking with Bettermode, Mariah Olson, Head of Community and Safety at Schoolhouse explained more about why Schoolhouse needed community and what it was like building one so quickly.`,

She also said that the community space gives a continuous learning experience since students have somewhere to go when a formal tutoring session ends.
The Schoolhouse team also loves the community because it’s a centralized place where they can connect with students. Previously, this wasn’t possible since they only connected with Tutors via Slack. Now, they have the Bettermode space to develop deeper relationships. Going forward, this will be essential for the product team because they can use the community to get first-person feedback from students in conversations rather than relying on cold outreach.
